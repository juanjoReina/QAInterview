## General Notes
In order to execute the automated tests you need to execute the following:
- protractor config.js

Results are generated by default in JSON format, however, as was requested I have used an external tool to get them in HTML format:
-You can find them in cucumber_report.html

## Exercise 1
Scenarios written in cucumber can be found in:
- /Features/firstExerciseManualScenarios.feature

I have written some notes inside the field about what I understand regarding this exercise and what I have done.

## Exercise 2
Automated scenarios are in:
- /Features/automatedScenarios.feature

Implementations of the steps are in
- /Features/stepsDefinitions/

I have created two javascript files, one per page of functionality.
Methods used in the steps implementations are in:
- /PageObject/

As per the Page Object Model pattern I have created two files, each one contains the methods to be used in each page (Login and Signup).
Moreover, I also put the methods I thought might be used in several places, like navigate to URL or click an option in a combo element.

## Additonal Notes:
-I have never used protractor before or cucumberJS, so probably the implementations of the steps could be implemented in a better way! (I mean callbacks and promises, not sure if this way I used is correct)

-The login test is failing due to the redirection, instead of /profile is redirected to /lobby
